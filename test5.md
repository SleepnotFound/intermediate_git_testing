writing stuff down to test branching and merging.
note: after creating this test5 and using git commit -am, it did not stage this file and did not commit.
added this file normally using git add . and THEN proceded with git commit -am. worked this time around

testing if git commit -am will work on an existing file only with new content added.
note: worked as intended. since file was modified and tracked git commit -am will work for this file from now onward.
